# Tower Defense LvlUp
After developing a 2D tower defense game in Java on my 2nd year as an IT student it was only appropriate to do the same using Unity and 3D graphics.  It was a part of Computer Graphic course during 4th and final year.

## Using
In the demo directory you can run the game on Windows machines. For all the other things you want to do, you'd have to import the TowerDefense directory as a Unity project.
